# The .vscode folder contains launch configuration and tasks you configure in
# VS Code which you may want to be tracked by git if you want to share the launch
# configuration with team members. However, if you are using Git for a team project,
# it is recommended to not include these files in the repository. Instead, copy the
# file to a new name and commit the template, as it avoids merge conflicts.
# In this case, the launch configuration would be checked in, and .vscode/settings.json
# would be gitignored.
